Discussions: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Basic knowledge of organic chemistry required. Students need permission from the instructor to enroll.

Overview and Calendar
---------------------

This course evaluates and discusses the formation and diagnostic structural properties of organic compounds with particular emphasis on those molecules which form chemical fossils. It is structured around the biosynthetic and phylogenetic origins of recalcitrant hydrocarbons.
